# [Multitask-Learning-For-Facial-Expression-Analysis-FER-plus-FES](https://github.com/RickZ1010/Multitask-Learning-in-Facial-Expression-Analysis-FET-plus-FER)

## Intordction
This is the implementation of the paper, "DEEP MULTI-TASK LEARNING FOR FACIAL EXPRESSION RECOGNITION WITH EXPRESSION SYNTHESIS REGULARIZATION VIA SELECTIVE FEATURE SHARING". We propose a novel selective feature-sharing method, and establish a multi-task network for facial expression recognition and facial expression synthesis (FERSNet). The proposed method can effectively transfer beneficial features between different tasks, while filtering out useless and harmful information.

## Depandencies
Python >= 3.6.5, Pytorch >= 0.4.1, and cuda-9.2.

## Network architecture
The proposed multi-task network:
